On Windows:

cd r1
../../bin/bpp_avx ../A00.bpp.ctl


on MAC os or linux/unix:

cd r1
..\..\bin\bpp_avx ..\A00.bpp.ctl


The files in this folder are for the tutorial of Yang (2015).  
That tutorial was writtne for bpp 3, which uses gamma priors on theta's and tau_0.
However, the current version of bpp uses the inverse gamma priors, and the control files 
have been edited accordingly.
